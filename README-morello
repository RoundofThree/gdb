The Morello [1] architecture is a prototype implementation of the capability-based
CHERI [2] architecture in AArch64, intended to promote research into capability
architectures and their deployment.

This branch contains binutils and gdb support for Morello.
The ABI-related parts of the work are in alpha state and are likely to change.

As Morello is a prototype architecture we intend to maintain the toolchain
components on a branch rather than integrate it into master.
To report bugs please use the GitLab mirror set up at:
https://git.morello-project.org/morello-gnu-toolchain/binutils-gdb
